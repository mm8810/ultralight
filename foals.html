    <b>1</b>

                In the dew-saturated foot-high blades of grass, 
                            we stand amongst a sea
                of foals, mare and foal, mare and foal,
                             all over the soft hillside there are twos,
                
                small duos ringing harmoniously in the cold,
                             swallows diving in and out, their fabled
                 
                 forked tail where the story says the fireball
                             hit it as it flew to bring fire to humanity.
                 
                 Our friend the Irishman drives us in the Gator
                             to sit amongst them. Everywhere doubles
                 
                 of horses still leaning on each other, still nuzzling
                             and curious with each new image.
                 
    <b>2</b>
                 
                 Two female horses, retired mares, separated
                             by a sliding barn door, nose each other.
                 
                 Neither of them will get pregnant again,
                             their job is to just be a horse. Sometimes,
                 
                 though, they cling to one another, find a friend
                             and will whine all night for the friend
                 
                 to be released. Through the gate, the noses
                             touch, and you can almost hear—
                 
                 Are you okay? Are you okay?

                 I will never be a mother.
                 
                 That’s all. That’s the whole thought.
                 
                 I could say it returns to me, watching the horses.
                 
                 Which is true.
                 
                 But also I could say that it came to me
                 
                 as the swallows circled us over and over,
                 
                 something about that myth of their tail,
                 
                 how generosity is punished by the gods.
                 
                 But isn’t that going too far? I saw a mare
                 
                 with her foal, and then many mares
                 
                 with many foals, and I thought, simply:
                 
                 I will never be a mother.
                 
    <b>4</b> 
                 
                 One foal is a biter, and you must watch
                 him as he bares his teeth and goes
                 for the soft spot. He’s brilliant, leggy,
                 and comes right at me, as if directed
                 by some greater gravity, and I stand
                 firm, and put my hand out first, rub
                 the long white marking on his forehead,
                 silence his need for biting with affection.
                 I love his selfishness, our selfishness,
                 the two of us testing each other, swallows
                 all around us. Every now and then, his
                 teeth come at me once again; he wants
                 to teach me something, wants to get me
                 where it hurts.
