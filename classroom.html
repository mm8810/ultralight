        <h3>the room i'm sitting in: </h3>
        The thingsthat <span>are the most immediate </span>are the easiest to enumerate…
The rushof tires <span>hitting water, soft rumble,</span> ten thousand splashes that join to one
<span>It comes in waves,</span> organic motion of humans subconsciously organizing, heading elsewhere?
Perhaps soundis the most present form of observation to me right now… it’s obvious to hear the rhythmofthe clacks and drips and creaks… the readjusting of us and of nature. A gentle hum requires more attention.
<span>Awareness of self comes next?</span> Temperature maybe… there’s a chill biting my left shoulder, the one exposed to the gusty window and a chill of aplastic seat that hasn’t yet warmed to my form. I think about how I’ve been in the same position for three hours and it hasn’t warmed. I wonder if it’s the quality of the material?
Maybe i’ll lift my eyes up from this laptopfor a minute to take a minute for the visual? Observation end.
