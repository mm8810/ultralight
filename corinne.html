    <h1>corinne's house</h1>
    <p>i press myself into the scratchy carpet</p>
    <p>the world's worst american chinese on a styrofoam plate</p>
    <p>elementary middle high college phases that all blend into me and her and her and me</p>
    <p>we live in parallel, years of discovery, yearning, and mourning.</p>

    <h2>let's hang out!</h2>
    <p>i walk in as if i've been doing this every day. the cold sticky linoleum and fennel seed greets me. <a href = "poem1.html"><span class="dialogue dialogue1" id="dialogue1">"cooking?"</span></a>
        <br>
        <a href = "poem2.html"><span class="dialogue dialogue2" id="dialogue2">"chickpeas."</span></a>
        <br>
        three months ago? i ask about robbie about may about michelle.
        <a href = "poem3.html"><span class="dialogue dialogue3" id="dialogue3">"not too good, love, annoyance"</span></a>
        greasy plates are dealt between punches of laughter and punch. ice clinks away at chipped souvenier mugs. i remember our clumsy fourth grade road trip, ripped canvas sneakers and skinned knees.

            <p>that time of evening comes, when the hum of voices mist out, when the gravity of our limbs starts to ground us. inertia and the remaining bits of high pull us together.</p>
            <p>i'm struck with how bouncy the keyboard sounds... there's an oceanic quality to it and i swivel around and around in corinne's chair. she breaks from her mcat textbook to look over my shoulder. we smile!</p>
